What is Mandarin?
-----------------

Mandarin is the most widely spoken language in China and one of the world's most spoken languages, with over 1.3 billion native speakers. It belongs to the Sino-Tibetan language family and is the official language of China, Taiwan, and Singapore. Mandarin is also known as "Putonghua" in mainland China and "Guoyu" in Taiwan, which both translate to "common language."

Historical Background
---------------------

The origins of Mandarin can be traced back to ancient China, where various regional dialects were spoken. The standardized form of Mandarin that we know today, known as Modern Standard Mandarin (MSM), evolved from the Beijing dialect. MSM was established as the official language of China in the early 20th century.

### Classical Chinese and Literary Tradition

Before the establishment of Mandarin as the official language, Classical Chinese was widely used for literary and administrative purposes. Classical Chinese, also known as Wenyanwen, was based on the ancient written language used during the Zhou dynasty (1046--256 BCE). It served as the written form of communication among scholars and intellectuals.

### Emergence of Mandarin as the National Language

During the Qing dynasty (1644--1912), the Beijing dialect gained prominence due to the city's political and cultural significance. As the capital, Beijing became the center of imperial power, leading to the spread of the Beijing dialect among government officials and the educated class.

After the fall of the Qing dynasty, movements for language standardization gained momentum. In 1913, the Republic of China government declared the Beijing dialect as the basis for a national language, which later became known as Guoyu (National Language). This laid the foundation for Modern Standard Mandarin.

### Promotion of Mandarin in Modern China

The People's Republic of China, established in 1949, continued the efforts to promote Mandarin as a unifying language for the nation. Mandarin education was prioritized, and measures were taken to increase its usage in public institutions, media, and daily life.

To ensure consistency and accessibility, the government launched the "Putonghua" campaign in the mid-20th century. Putonghua refers to the standardized form of Mandarin that is now widely taught and used throughout mainland China.

Features of Mandarin
--------------------

Mandarin is characterized by several distinctive features:

* **Tonal Language**: Mandarin is a tonal language, meaning that the meaning of a word can change depending on the tone in which it is pronounced. There are four tones in Mandarin: high level, rising, falling then rising, and falling.
* **Simplified Characters**: Simplified Chinese characters are used in mainland China, making the written form of Mandarin more accessible and easier to learn compared to Traditional Chinese characters.
* **Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) Sentence Structure**: Mandarin typically follows the Subject-Verb-Object sentence structure.
* **Pinyin System**: Pinyin is a phonetic system that uses Roman letters to represent Mandarin sounds. It is widely used for pronunciation guides and input methods for Chinese characters.
